I am passionate about User Experience and my goal is to create efficient digital products that positively impact users. I truly believe in the value of correctly framing, then solving real peopleâ€™s problems to help them reach their goals.
My experience covers the Design process all the way from researching, ideating and problem framing, to prototyping and testing. With a background as Project Manager and Scrum Master, I have a solid understanding and clear perspective on the Agile development approach and how Scrum teams operate. As an advocate for Design, this is a useful advantage when sharing my knowledge of the Design mindset and methodologies.
